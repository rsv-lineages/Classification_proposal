#This repository contains the results described in the article "The unified proposal for classification of human respiratory syncytial virus below the subgroup level"

Full-genomes-trees: contains the maximum likelihood trees reconstrusted with the complete genome dataset used for the classification

Augur-trees-autolin: contains the json files used to evaluate different classification thresholds with autolin online tool (https://github.com/jmcbroome/automated-lineage-json.git), that can be visualized in https://auspice.us/

G-gene-trees: contains the maximum likelihood trees reconstrusted with the G gene region of the dataset used for the classification

Tanglegram-trees: contains the maximum likelihood trees inferred with the 5’ and 3’ ends of the alignments (4,500-nt each) that can be visualized in https://auspice.us/

Outgroup-rooted-trees: contains the maximum likelihood trees with the complete genome dataset used for the classification rooted against an outgroup

Phylodynamic-trees: contains the phylodynamic trees reconstrusted with treetime using the complete genomes dataset for the classification 

Classification-excluded-genomes: contains the maximum likelihood trees to classify genomes excluded from the classification dataset, using the reference alignment
